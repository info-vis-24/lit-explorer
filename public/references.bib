                  comprehensible way. A standard visualization technique is to
                  enclose the point sets in isocontours generated by bounding a
                  potential field function. The most commonly used functions are
                  various approximations of the Gaussian distribution. Such an
                  approach produces smooth and appealing shapes, however it may
                  produce an incorrect point nesting in generated regions, e.g.
                  some point is contained inside a foreign set region. We
                  introduce a different potential field function that keeps the
                  desired properties of Gaussian distribution, and in addition
                  guarantees that every point belongs to all its sets' regions
                  and no others, and that regions of two sets with no common
                  points have no overlaps. The presented function works well if
                  the sets intersect each other, a situation that often arises
                  in social network graphs, producing regions that reveal the
                  structure of their clustering.",

                  visualize sets. However, there is a significant lack of

                  address this knowledge gap, this paper empirically evaluates
                  four diagram types: Venn diagrams, Euler diagrams with
                  shading, Euler diagrams without shading, and the less well-
                  known linear diagrams. By collecting performance data (time to
                  complete tasks and error rate), through crowdsourcing, we
                  establish that linear diagrams outperform the other three
                  diagram types in terms of both task completion time and number
                  of errors. Venn diagrams perform worst from both perspectives.
                  Thus, we provide evidence that linear diagrams are the most
                  effective of these four diagram types for representing sets.",

                  belong exclusively to the red set, and purple points belong to
                  both sets. A red-blue-purple spanning graph (RBP spanning

  abstract     = "<jats:p> Fuzzy set refers to the data set which does not have
                  separate, distinct clusters, and they contain data elements
                  whose membership degrees are between 0.0 and 1.0. Many fuzzy
                  sets exist in the real world, and one of the important issues
                  is to make a decision from the fuzzy sets using visual
                  analytics tools by extracting information in the data set
                  intuitively. To analyze the element data in fuzzy sets, the
                  visualization of fuzzy sets needs to show an overview of the
                  data with membership degree and the relationship among the
                  sets. In this article, we suggest an interactive visualization
                  technique of fuzzy set operations, called Disk Diagram, which
                  offers distribution of fuzzy data and two scenarios to allow
                  users to interpret inter-dependency among fuzzy sets. A Disk
                  Diagram enables to depict complexity of fuzzy sets by showing
                  the degree of resemblance between the sets with the layout of
                  star coordinates. This article describes the use of a Disk
                  Diagram with two different data sets such as fuzzy disease set
                  and terror related words set. Lastly, we report the results of
                  heuristic evaluation to show that our technique supports
                  visual perception, usability, and knowledge discovery process
                  in the areas of visual representation and interaction.

                  positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position,

                  be modeled as a graph with additional attributes attached to
                  the nodes. For example, a graph can be used to model the
                  relationship of people in a social media website or a
                  bibliographical dataset. Meanwhile, additional information is
                  often available, such as the topics people are interested in
                  and the music they listen to. Based on this additional
                  information, different set relationships may exist among
                  people. Revealing the set relationships in a network can help
                  people gain social insight and better understand their roles
                  within a community. In this paper, we present a visualization
                  system for exploring set relations in a graph. Our system is
                  designed to reveal three different relationships
                  simultaneously: the social relationship of people, the set
                  relationship among people's items of interest, and the
                  similarity relationship of the items. We propose two novel
                  visualization designs: a) a glyphÃ¢â‚¬based visualization to
                  reveal people's set relationships in the context of their
                  social networks; b) an integration of visual links and a
                  contour map to show people and their items of interest which
                  are clustered into different groups. The effectiveness of the
                  designs has been demonstrated by the case studies on two
                  representative datasets including one from a social music
                  service website and another from an academic collaboration

                  These categories, together with information about when
                  categories share some datum, can be turned into a succinct
                  diagram description from which an Euler diagram can be
                  generated. Closed curves represent the categories and the
                  relationships between the curves (such as containment)
                  correspond to relationships between the categories (such as
                  subset). A range of automated Euler diagram drawing methods
                  have been proposed but they often produce diagrams that are
                  aesthetically unpleasing, can be computationally complex and
                  most of them cannot draw a diagram for some (often many) given
                  collections of categories. One such method is capable of
                  drawing aesthetically pleasing Euler diagrams, using only
                  circles, and is computationally efficient (being of polynomial
                  time complexity) but it applies to a very restricted subset of
                  collections of categorized data. This paper substantially
                  extends that method so it can always draw an Euler diagram,
                  that is it applies to all collections of categorized data. In
                  particular, we identify a class of diagram descriptions that
                  can be drawn with circles, generalizing previous work. For
                  diagram descriptions outside of this class, we define
                  transformations that can be used to turn them into
                  descriptions inside the 'drawable with circles' class. We
                  demonstrate how such transformations can be done in a general,
                  a process during which many choices must be made. Further, we
                  provide strategies for making particular choices which ensure
                  desirable properties, such as curve containment, are
                  preserved. We have provided a software implementation of the

                  They are often used to represent information about  the
                  relationship between sets and, as such, they have  numerous
                  applications including: visualizing biological  data,
                  diagrammatic logics, and visual database querying.  Various
                  methods to automatically generate Euler diagrams  have been
                  proposed recently. Typically, the generation  process starts
                  with an abstract description of an Euler  diagram, which is
                  then converted to a planar dual graph.  Finally, the process
                  attempts to embed the Euler diagram  from the dual graph. This
                  paper describes a method for  embedding wellformed Euler
                  diagrams from dual graphs.  There are several mechanisms to
                  generate dual graphs but,  prior to the novel work described
                  here, no general method  for embedding a wellformed Euler
                  diagram from a dual  graph had been demonstrated. The method
                  in this paper  achieves an embedding of any wellformed Euler
                  diagram.  The method first triangulates the dual graph. Then,
                  using  the faces of the triangulated graph, an edge labelling
                  technique identifies the vertices of polygons which form the
                  closed curves of the Euler diagram. The method is demonstrated
                  by a Java implementation. In addition, this paper discusses a
                  number of layout improvements that can  be explored for this
                  embedding method. ",

  abstract     = "Abstract: Euler diagrams have a wide variety of uses, from
                  information visualization to logical reasoning. In the case of
                  software engineering, they form the basis of a number of
                  notations, such as state charts and constraint diagrams. In
                  all of their application areas, the ability to automatically
                  layout Euler diagrams brings considerable benefits. There have
                  been several recent contributions towards the automatic
                  generation and layout of Euler diagrams, all of which start
                  from an abstract description of the diagram and produce a
                  collection of closed curves embedded in the plane. In this
                  paper, we are concerned with producing layouts by modifying
                  existing ones. This type of layout approach is particularly
                  useful in domains where we require an updated, or modified,
                  diagram such as in a logical reasoning context. We provide two

                  various medical and scientific disciplines to visualize
                  relationships between data sets and facilitate data analysis.
                  The area of the regions formed by the overlapping curves is
                  often directly proportional to the cardinality of the depicted
                  set relation or any other related quantitative data. Drawing
                  these diagrams manually is difficult and current automatic
                  drawing methods do not always produce appropriate diagrams.
                  Most methods depict the data sets as circles, as they
                  perceptually pop out as complete distinct objects due to their
                  smoothness and regularity. However, circles cannot draw
                  accurate diagrams for most 3-set data and so the generated
                  diagrams often have misleading region areas. Other methods use
                  polygons to draw accurate diagrams. However, polygons are non-
                  smooth and non-symmetric, so the curves are not easily
                  distinguishable and the diagrams are difficult to comprehend.
                  Ellipses are more flexible than circles and are similarly
                  smooth, but none of the current automatic drawing methods use
                  ellipses. We present eulerAPE as the first method and software
                  that uses ellipses for automatically drawing accurate area-
                  proportional Venn diagrams for 3-set data. We describe the

                  evaluation of the effectiveness of eulerAPE and ellipses for
                  drawing random 3-set data. We compare eulerAPE and various
                  other methods that are currently available and we discuss

  abstract     = "Area-proportional Venn diagrams are a popular way of
                  visualizing the relationships between data sets, where the set
                  intersections have a specified numerical value. In these
                  diagrams, the areas of the regions are in proportion to the
                  given values. Venn-3, the Venn diagram consisting of three
                  intersecting curves, has been used in many applications,
                  including marketing, ecology and medicine. Whilst circles are
                  widely used to draw such diagrams, most area specifications
                  cannot be drawn in this way and, so, should only be used where
                  an approximate solution is acceptable. However, placing
                  different restrictions on the shape of curves may result in
                  usable diagrams that have an exact solution, that is, where
                  the areas of the regions are exactly in proportion to the
                  represented data. In this paper, we explore the use of convex
                  shapes for drawing exact area proportional Venn-3 diagrams.
                  Convex curves reduce the visual complexity of the diagram and,
                  as most desirable shapes (such as circles, ovals and
                  rectangles) are convex, the work described here may lead to
                  further drawing methods with these shapes. We describe methods
                  for constructing convex diagrams with polygons that have four
                  or five sides and derive results concerning which area
                  specifications can be drawn with them. This work improves the
                  state-of-the-art by extending the set of area specifications
                  that can be drawn in a convex manner. We also show how, when a
                  specification cannot be drawn in a convex manner, a non-convex
                  drawing can be generated.",

                  Currently, there is no tool that will reliably visualize exact
                  area-proportional diagrams for up to three sets. Limited
                  success, in terms of diagram accuracy, has been achieved for a
                  small number of cases, such as Venn-2 and Venn-3 where all
                  intersections between the sets must be represented. Euler
                  diagrams do not have to include all intersections and so
                  permit the  visualization of cases where some intersections
                  have a zero value. This paper describes a general,
                  implemented, method for  visualizing all 40 Euler-3 diagrams

                  circles. For the cases where non-convex curves are necessary,
                  our method draws an appropriate diagram  using non-convex
                  polygons. Thus, we are now always able to automatically

                  A more natural and convenient mode of entry is via a sketching
                  interface which facilitates greater cognitive focus on the
                  task of diagram creation. Previous work has developed
                  sketching interfaces for Euler diagrams drawn with ellipses.
                  This paper presents SketchSet, the first sketch tool for Euler
                  diagrams whose curves can be circles, ellipses, or arbitrary
                  shapes. SketchSet allows the creation of formal diagrams via

                  curves which are commonly described as retinal variables to

                  visual languages, are an effective representation of
                  information, but they can become cluttered. Previous research
                  established a measure of Euler diagram clutter, empirically
                  shown to correspond with how people perceive clutter. However,
                  the impact of clutter on user understanding is unknown. An
                  empirical study was executed with three levels of diagram
                  clutter. We found a significant effect: increased diagram
                  clutter leads to significantly worse performance, measured by
                  time and error rates. In addition, we found a significant
                  effect of zone (a region in the diagram) clutter on time and
                  error rates. Surprisingly, the zones with a middle level of
                  clutter had the highest error rate compared to the zones with
                  lowest and the highest clutter. Also, the questions whose
                  answers were placed in zones with medium clutter had the
                  highest mean time taken to answer questions. In conclusion,
                  both diagram clutter and zone clutter impact the
                  interpretation of Euler diagrams. Consequently, future work
                  will establish whether a single, but cluttered, Euler diagram
                  is a more effective representation of information than

                  sets in applications such as criminology; genetics, medicine,
                  and computer file systems. One interesting aspect of these
                  diagrams is that some data sets cannot be drawn without
                  breaking one or more 'wellformedness properties', which are
                  considered to reduce the user comprehension of the diagrams.
                  However, it is possible to draw the same data with different
                  diagrams, each of which breaks different wellformedness
                  properties. Hence, some properties are 'swappable', so
                  motivating the study of which of the alternatives would be
                  best to use. This paper reports on the two empirical studies
                  to determine how wellformedness properties affect
                  comprehension. One study was with abstract data, the other was
                  with concrete data that visualized students' enrollment on
                  university modules. We have results from both studies that
                  imply that diagrams with concurrency or disconnected zones
                  perform less well than other some other properties. Further,
                  we have no results that imply that diagrams with brushing
                  points adversely affect performance. Our data also indicate
                  that nonsimple curves are preferred less than diagrams with
                  other properties. These results will inform both human diagram
                  designers and the developers of automated drawing systems on
                  the best way to visualize data using Euler diagrams.",

                  contour jaggedness, zone area  inequality and edge closeness.
                  Subjects were asked to  interpret diagrams with different

                  better known forms of set visualization, such as Venn and
                  Euler diagrams, in supporting non-interactive assessment of
                  set relationships. Recent studies that compared several
                  variants of linear diagrams have demonstrated that users
                  perform best at tasks involving identification of
                  intersections, disjointness and subsets when using a
                  horizontally drawn linear diagram with thin lines representing
                  sets and employing vertical lines as guide lines. The
                  essential visual task the user needs to perform in order to
                  interpret this kind of diagram is vertical alignment of
                  parallel lines and detection of overlaps. Space-filling mosaic
                  diagrams which support this same visual task have been used in
                  other applications, such as the visualization of schedules of
                  activities, where they have been shown to be superior to
                  linear Gantt charts. In this article, we present an
                  experimental comparison of linear and mosaic diagrams for
                  visualization of set relationships, in terms of accuracy,
                  time-to-answer and subjective ratings of perceived task
                  difficulty. The findings show that the two visualizations are
                  largely similar with respect to these measures, suggesting
                  that the choice of one or the other may be solely guided by
                  other visual design considerations. Mosaic diagrams might be
                  more suitable, for instance, in cases where miniature diagrams
                  representing overviews of relations in different collections
                  of sets are required, such as in small-multiples displays.",

                  set-typed data. However, creating diagrams using simple shapes
                  remains a challenging problem for many complex, real-life
                  datasets. To solve this, we propose RectEuler: a flexible,
                  fully-automatic method using rectangles to create Euler-like
                  diagrams. We use an efficient mixed-integer optimization
                  scheme to place set labels and element representatives (e.g.,
                  text or images) in conjunction with rectangles describing the
                  sets. By defining appropriate constraints, we adhere to well-
                  formedness properties and aesthetic considerations. If a
                  dataset cannot be created within a reasonable time or at all,
                  we iteratively split the diagram into multiple components

                  visualization of relationships between experiments and
                  datasets. However, representing more than three datasets while
                  keeping the proportions of each region is still not feasible
                  with existing tools.We present an algorithm to render all the
                  regions of a generalized n-dimensional Venn diagram, while
                  keeping the area of each region approximately proportional to
                  the number of elements included. In addition, missing regions
                  in Euler diagrams lead to simplified representations. The
                  algorithm generates an n-dimensional Venn diagram and inserts
                  circles of given areas in each region. Then, the diagram is
                  rearranged with a dynamic, self-correcting simulation in which
                  each set border is contracted until it contacts the circles

                  studies focused on the scalability of visualizing set
                  relations, rather than on set-typed data itself. Although
                  solving such problems is important, understanding the
                  structural context of the entire data is also essential for
                  analyzing data. We propose NetSet, which combines two
                  techniques to resolve the limitations in representing set

                  structural overview of the set system. Then, we place a matrix

                  challenging to visualize the temporal change in set membership

                  masters, which skills an applicant documents, or which

                  entities, the resulting element-set membership matrix becomes
                  very rich of information about how these sets overlap. Many

                  presents Radial Sets, a novel visual technique to analyze set

                  possibly belonging to more than one set. A typical example is
                  the properties of the 20 amino-acids. A more complex
                  application is the visual comparison of the contraindications
                  or the adverse effects of several similar drugs. The knowledge
                  involved is voluminous, each drug has many contraindications
                  and adverse effects, some of them are shared with other drugs.
                  Another real-life application is the visualization of gene
                  annotation, each gene product being annotated with several
                  annotation terms indicating the associated biological

                  principles are justified through empirical studies that
                  evaluate the impact of graphical features on task performance.
                  Linear diagrams represent sets using straight line segments,
                  with line overlaps corresponding to set intersections. This
                  study builds on recent empirical research, which establishes
                  that linear diagrams can be superior to prominent set
                  visualization techniques, namely Euler and Venn diagrams. We
                  address the problem of how to best visualize overlapping sets
                  using linear diagrams. To solve the problem, we investigate
                  which graphical features of linear diagrams significantly
                  impact user task performance. To this end, we conducted seven
                  crowdsourced empirical studies involving a total of 1,760
                  participants. These studies allowed us to identify the
                  following design principles, which significantly aid task
                  performance: use a minimal number of line segments, use
                  guidelines where overlaps start and end, and draw lines that
                  are thin as opposed to thick bars. We also evaluated the
                  following graphical properties that did not significantly
                  impact task performance: color, orientation, and set order.
                  The results are brought to life through a freely available
                  software implementation that automatically draws linear
                  diagrams with user-controlled graphical choices. An important
                  consequence of our research is that users are now able to
                  create effective visualizations of sets automatically, thus
                  improving human--computer interaction.",

  abstract     = "Set visualization is a well-known task in information
                  visualization. In biology, it is used for comparing visually
                  sets of genes or proteins, typically using Venn diagrams.
                  However, limitations of the Venn diagram are well-known: they
                  are limited to 6 sets and difficult to read above 4. Many
                  other set visualization techniques have been proposed, but
                  they have never been widely used in biology. In this paper, we
                  introduce RainBio, a technique for visualizing sets in biology
                  and aimed at providing a global overview showing the size of
                  the main intersections, in a proportional way, and the
                  similarities between sets. We adapt rainbow boxes, a technique
                  for visualizing small datasets, to the visualization of larger
                  sets, using element aggregation and intersection clustering.
                  We present the application of RainBio to three datasets, with
                  5, 6 and 12 sets. We also describe a small user study
                  comparing RainBio with Venn diagrams, involving 30 students in
                  biology. Results showed that RainBio led to significantly
                  fewer errors on 6-set dataset, and that the majority of
                  students preferred RainBio. RainBio is proposed as a web-based
                  tool for up to 15 sets.",

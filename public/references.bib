                  determine topics that discriminate a subset of collections
                  from the remaining ones by applying probabilistic topic
                  modeling and subsequently approximating the two relevant
                  criteria distinctiveness and characteristicness
                  algorithmically through a set of heuristics. Furthermore, we
                  suggest a novel visualization method called DiTop-View, in
                  which topics are represented by glyphs (topic coins) that are
                  arranged on a 2D plane. Topic coins are designed to encode all
                  information necessary for performing comparative analyses such
                  as the class membership of a topic, its most probable terms

  abstract     = "<jats:p> Fuzzy set refers to the data set which does not have
                  separate, distinct clusters, and they contain data elements
                  whose membership degrees are between 0.0 and 1.0. Many fuzzy
                  sets exist in the real world, and one of the important issues
                  is to make a decision from the fuzzy sets using visual
                  analytics tools by extracting information in the data set
                  intuitively. To analyze the element data in fuzzy sets, the
                  visualization of fuzzy sets needs to show an overview of the
                  data with membership degree and the relationship among the
                  sets. In this article, we suggest an interactive visualization
                  technique of fuzzy set operations, called Disk Diagram, which
                  offers distribution of fuzzy data and two scenarios to allow
                  users to interpret inter-dependency among fuzzy sets. A Disk
                  Diagram enables to depict complexity of fuzzy sets by showing
                  the degree of resemblance between the sets with the layout of
                  star coordinates. This article describes the use of a Disk
                  Diagram with two different data sets such as fuzzy disease set
                  and terror related words set. Lastly, we report the results of
                  heuristic evaluation to show that our technique supports
                  visual perception, usability, and knowledge discovery process
                  in the areas of visual representation and interaction.

                  taxonomies and sets has recently become an active area of
                  research. Many application fields now require more than a
                  strict classification of elements into a hierarchy tree. Euler
                  diagrams, one of the most natural ways of depicting
                  intersecting sets, may provide a solution to these
                  problems.</jats:p><jats:p>In this paper, we present an
                  approach for the automatic generation of EulerÃ¢â‚¬like
                  diagrams. This algorithm differs from previous approaches in
                  that it has no undrawable instances of input, allowing it to
                  be used in systems where the output is always required. We
                  also improve the readability of Euler diagrams through the use
                  of BÃƒÂ©zier curves and transparent coloured textures. Our
                  approach has been implemented using the Tulip platform. Both
                  the source and executable program used to generate the results

                  be modeled as a graph with additional attributes attached to
                  the nodes. For example, a graph can be used to model the
                  relationship of people in a social media website or a
                  bibliographical dataset. Meanwhile, additional information is
                  often available, such as the topics people are interested in
                  and the music they listen to. Based on this additional
                  information, different set relationships may exist among
                  people. Revealing the set relationships in a network can help
                  people gain social insight and better understand their roles
                  within a community. In this paper, we present a visualization
                  system for exploring set relations in a graph. Our system is
                  designed to reveal three different relationships
                  simultaneously: the social relationship of people, the set
                  relationship among people's items of interest, and the
                  similarity relationship of the items. We propose two novel
                  visualization designs: a) a glyphÃ¢â‚¬based visualization to
                  reveal people's set relationships in the context of their
                  social networks; b) an integration of visual links and a
                  contour map to show people and their items of interest which
                  are clustered into different groups. The effectiveness of the
                  designs has been demonstrated by the case studies on two
                  representative datasets including one from a social music
                  service website and another from an academic collaboration
                  network.</jats:p>",

                  tool support for creating them is generally limited to generic
                  diagram editing software using mouse and keyboard interaction.
                  A more natural and convenient mode of entry is via a sketching
                  interface which facilitates greater cognitive focus on the
                  task of diagram creation. Previous work has developed
                  sketching interfaces for Euler diagrams drawn with ellipses.
                  This paper presents SketchSet, the first sketch tool for Euler
                  diagrams whose curves can be circles, ellipses, or arbitrary
                  shapes. SketchSet allows the creation of formal diagrams via
                  point and click interaction. The user drawn diagram, in
                  sketched or formal format, is automatically converted to a
                  diagram in the other format, thus maintaining both views. We
                  provide a mechanism that allows semantic differences between
                  the sketch and the formal diagram to be rectified
                  automatically. Finally, we present a user study that evaluates
                  the effectiveness of the tool.",

                  curves which are commonly described as retinal variables to
                  which we are known to be perceptually sensitive. There is

                  visual languages, are an effective representation of
                  information, but they can become cluttered. Previous research
                  established a measure of Euler diagram clutter, empirically
                  shown to correspond with how people perceive clutter. However,
                  the impact of clutter on user understanding is unknown. An
                  empirical study was executed with three levels of diagram
                  clutter. We found a significant effect: increased diagram
                  clutter leads to significantly worse performance, measured by
                  time and error rates. In addition, we found a significant
                  effect of zone (a region in the diagram) clutter on time and
                  error rates. Surprisingly, the zones with a middle level of
                  clutter had the highest error rate compared to the zones with
                  lowest and the highest clutter. Also, the questions whose
                  answers were placed in zones with medium clutter had the
                  highest mean time taken to answer questions. In conclusion,
                  both diagram clutter and zone clutter impact the
                  interpretation of Euler diagrams. Consequently, future work
                  will establish whether a single, but cluttered, Euler diagram
                  is a more effective representation of information than
                  multiple, but less cluttered, Euler diagrams.",

                  sets in applications such as criminology; genetics, medicine,
                  and computer file systems. One interesting aspect of these
                  diagrams is that some data sets cannot be drawn without
                  breaking one or more 'wellformedness properties', which are
                  considered to reduce the user comprehension of the diagrams.
                  However, it is possible to draw the same data with different
                  diagrams, each of which breaks different wellformedness
                  properties. Hence, some properties are 'swappable', so
                  motivating the study of which of the alternatives would be
                  best to use. This paper reports on the two empirical studies
                  to determine how wellformedness properties affect
                  comprehension. One study was with abstract data, the other was
                  with concrete data that visualized students' enrollment on
                  university modules. We have results from both studies that
                  imply that diagrams with concurrency or disconnected zones
                  perform less well than other some other properties. Further,
                  we have no results that imply that diagrams with brushing
                  points adversely affect performance. Our data also indicate
                  that nonsimple curves are preferred less than diagrams with
                  other properties. These results will inform both human diagram
                  designers and the developers of automated drawing systems on

                  better known forms of set visualization, such as Venn and
                  Euler diagrams, in supporting non-interactive assessment of
                  set relationships. Recent studies that compared several
                  variants of linear diagrams have demonstrated that users
                  perform best at tasks involving identification of
                  intersections, disjointness and subsets when using a
                  horizontally drawn linear diagram with thin lines representing
                  sets and employing vertical lines as guide lines. The
                  essential visual task the user needs to perform in order to
                  interpret this kind of diagram is vertical alignment of
                  parallel lines and detection of overlaps. Space-filling mosaic
                  diagrams which support this same visual task have been used in
                  other applications, such as the visualization of schedules of
                  activities, where they have been shown to be superior to
                  linear Gantt charts. In this article, we present an
                  experimental comparison of linear and mosaic diagrams for
                  visualization of set relationships, in terms of accuracy,
                  time-to-answer and subjective ratings of perceived task
                  difficulty. The findings show that the two visualizations are
                  largely similar with respect to these measures, suggesting
                  that the choice of one or the other may be solely guided by
                  other visual design considerations. Mosaic diagrams might be
                  more suitable, for instance, in cases where miniature diagrams
                  representing overviews of relations in different collections
                  of sets are required, such as in small-multiples displays.",

                  set-typed data. However, creating diagrams using simple shapes
                  remains a challenging problem for many complex, real-life
                  datasets. To solve this, we propose RectEuler: a flexible,
                  fully-automatic method using rectangles to create Euler-like
                  diagrams. We use an efficient mixed-integer optimization
                  scheme to place set labels and element representatives (e.g.,
                  text or images) in conjunction with rectangles describing the
                  sets. By defining appropriate constraints, we adhere to well-
                  formedness properties and aesthetic considerations. If a
                  dataset cannot be created within a reasonable time or at all,
                  we iteratively split the diagram into multiple components
                  until a drawable solution is found. Redundant encoding of the
                  set membership using dots and set lines improves the
                  readability of the diagram. Our web tool lets users see how
                  the layout changes throughout the optimization process and
                  provides interactive explanations. For evaluation, we perform
                  quantitative and qualitative analysis across different
                  datasets and compare our method to state-of-the-art Euler

                  keeping the proportions of each region is still not feasible
                  with existing tools.We present an algorithm to render all the

                  keeping the area of each region approximately proportional to
                  the number of elements included. In addition, missing regions
                  in Euler diagrams lead to simplified representations. The
                  algorithm generates an n-dimensional Venn diagram and inserts
                  circles of given areas in each region. Then, the diagram is
                  rearranged with a dynamic, self-correcting simulation in which
                  each set border is contracted until it contacts the circles

                  studies focused on the scalability of visualizing set
                  relations, rather than on set-typed data itself. Although
                  solving such problems is important, understanding the
                  structural context of the entire data is also essential for
                  analyzing data. We propose NetSet, which combines two
                  techniques to resolve the limitations in representing set
                  relationships. First, we construct a network to provide a
                  structural overview of the set system. Then, we place a matrix
                  layout to visualize intersections among sets. Finally, by
                  combining these two techniques, NetSet enables them to

                  changes over time. Since each element can be present in
                  multiple sets, the sets also overlap. As a result, it becomes
                  challenging to visualize the temporal change in set membership
                  of elements across several timesteps while showing individual
                  set intersections. We propose Set Streams, a visualization

                  timeline as branching and merging streams. The streams encode
                  the changing membership of elements with set intersections. A
                  query-based selection mechanism supports a flexible comparison

                  entities, the resulting element-set membership matrix becomes
                  very rich of information about how these sets overlap. Many

                  presents Radial Sets, a novel visual technique to analyze set

                  application is the visual comparison of the contraindications

                  involved is voluminous, each drug has many contraindications

                  Another real-life application is the visualization of gene

                  principles are justified through empirical studies that
                  evaluate the impact of graphical features on task performance.
                  Linear diagrams represent sets using straight line segments,
                  with line overlaps corresponding to set intersections. This
                  study builds on recent empirical research, which establishes
                  that linear diagrams can be superior to prominent set
                  visualization techniques, namely Euler and Venn diagrams. We
                  address the problem of how to best visualize overlapping sets
                  using linear diagrams. To solve the problem, we investigate
                  which graphical features of linear diagrams significantly
                  impact user task performance. To this end, we conducted seven
                  crowdsourced empirical studies involving a total of 1,760
                  participants. These studies allowed us to identify the
                  following design principles, which significantly aid task
                  performance: use a minimal number of line segments, use
                  guidelines where overlaps start and end, and draw lines that
                  are thin as opposed to thick bars. We also evaluated the
                  following graphical properties that did not significantly
                  impact task performance: color, orientation, and set order.
                  The results are brought to life through a freely available
                  software implementation that automatically draws linear
                  diagrams with user-controlled graphical choices. An important
                  consequence of our research is that users are now able to
